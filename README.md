[00:01.22] 皆さん！今日の楽しいライブ配信に
[00:04.32] 来てくれて、誠にありがとうございます
[00:07.13] 今日も、ラップしたいと思います
[00:08.91] では、始めましょうか？
[00:14.41] 
[00:10.77] ... Fuck it
[00:16.27] 
[00:11.32] Modern-day killers really must hate fun
[00:12.93] More often, people takin' lives rockin' knives and guns
[00:15.14] The real murder connoisseurs in the ruins of hell
[00:16.98] Got used to luring the audience with moe that sells, 'cause
[00:19.15] To my surprise, snatching' lives とりあえず禁止
[00:21.09] Nice try, stoppin' the motherfuckin' Da Vinci
[00:23.04] Of human erasure, can't stop the pace, sir
[00:24.99] Make sure whеn "standing off" my rhymes slay first
[00:26.87] Jealous haters out thеre, high-five! I see you
[00:28.89] "No one's gonna buy this." Bitch, I believe you!
[00:30.78] Cute as all hell, in a literal sense
[00:32.20] A bitter pretense
[00:33.03] But the views are all tell, no show, dollars and cents
[00:34.68] Don't mean nada to the queen of "Sayonara"
[00:36.56] Scythe and other super radical toys to tear your heart
[00:38.66] Apart at the seams, still the killer of your dreams!
[00:40.21] Slip your soul into my pocket, then I flee the scene-
[00:42.24] It's like that
[00:49.24] 
[00:42.72] If you take my advice, you'll be killed by what'cha don't know!
[00:45.97] But the other saying that I like so much more
[00:47.81] Is along the lines of "you reap what you fuckin' SEISO"
[00:50.25] Gotta know, ain't it so, could ya let go of your soul for me?
[00:52.78] すごいDIE好き〜
[00:53.64] I'm not asking for much: do me a favor and die?
[00:55.69] ごめん、失礼しますが死んでください〜
[01:04.69] 
[00:57.85] "Kill 'em with the bass"
[00:58.76] 殺すの事がTANOSHII
[01:01.61] (Teehee, bitch)
[01:02.68] Murder is so fucking KAWAII
[01:05.47] （かわいい、ね！）
[01:06.59] 死神先生+Calliope!
[01:09.41] Kill 'em with the bass, 'til we get 'em to say:
[01:11.01] Alright! "YAY! 素敵な暗殺〜"
[01:12.93] So it goes:
[01:18.43] 
[01:14.29] "Dead Beats, listen up!" It's what'cha want?
[01:15.96] Me comin' in the night for ya!
[01:18.32] 勝手にやってる地獄で犯罪じゃないから
[01:21.03] Bass high enough to exterminate ya
[01:22.95] You'll dance anyway, 'cause it's human nature
[01:24.60] でも、その前何となく一緒に楽しもう〜
[01:27.51] あなたの死ぬ日まで！
[01:32.51] 
[01:28.84] 申し訳ないです、やりすぎました
[01:30.90] なんで敬語でラップしてる？ちょっと変だ
[01:32.74] Not what you expected? Better tell you straight-forward
[01:34.62] Hear you all the way in hell, slamming on your keyboard
[01:36.67] Go ahead and BE sore, but I won't run
[01:38.11] 'Cause I'm a workaholic business-lady getting shit done
[01:40.13] Taking souls? Not an industry for suckers, for one
[01:42.02] But it's a mistress of darkness's day in the sun（きもい...）
[01:44.24] C A double L I O P E
[01:45.91] I really love this fake-murder shit's eye-opening
[01:47.94] Taking words I get right off the cuff, and script my own thing
[01:50.08] "Murder with words ain't enough?" that was the past me! (Sorry)
[01:51.90] Gonna take a first-class master V to blast me
[01:53.98] Humans, come at ME, I'm "masochistic" actually
[01:55.88] Huh... whatever that means.（何？）YES, whatever that means!!
[01:57.85] Come a little closer クソ鳥, THEN laugh at me!! (Sup bitch?!)
[02:26.85] 
[02:00.04] If you take my advice, you'll be killed by what'cha don't know!
[02:03.49] But inside, I'm kinda nervous and I don't know what the word is
[02:05.54] For the other side of the gap? FUCK IT, "清楚"!!
[02:07.51] Setting out, do as I'm supposed to do, I'll get close to you
[02:10.09] ドンマイ、DIE丈夫〜
[02:11.15] If it's alright with you, could I end your life?
[02:13.12] ごめん、失礼しますが死んでください〜
[02:22.12] 
[02:15.22] "Kill 'em with the bass"
[02:16.24] 殺すの事がTANOSHII
[02:19.18] (Teehee, bitch)
[02:20.14] Murder is so fucking KAWAII
[02:22.79] （かわいい、ね！）

[02:30.49] So it goes:
[02:35.99]

[02:38.43] Bass high enough to exterminate ya
[02:40.26] You'll dance anyway, 'cause it's human nature
[02:42.15] でも、その前何となく一緒に楽しもう〜
